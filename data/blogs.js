            Indirect lighting and mood lighting
          </h2>
          <p>
            Lighting can make the crucial difference in decor. Rooms that
            initially appear cool and sterile instantly become warm and inviting
            with the right lighting. We show you various ways to create a cosy
            atmosphere in your rooms:

              The illuminated handle grooves of the MatrixArt design give your
              kitchen a special atmosphere and emphasise the clear lines. At the
              same time, they provide pleasant, indirect lighting. Both the
              horizontal and vertical handle grooves can be illuminated
              individually.

            Effective and functional: Illumination of the work surface

          <p>
            A well-lit work surface is essential in the kitchen for cooking and
            preparing food. The lighting should be both practical and
            functional. Below, we show you various options for optimally
            integrating work lighting:

            </h2>
            <p className="text-justify">
              Under-cabinet lighting is installed by the kitchen fitter at the
              bottom of the cabinet, while recessed lights almost disappear
              flush with the surface, optimally illuminating the work surface.
              Ring lights look particularly aesthetic here, as the decor inside
              the light is repeated.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-justify">
              The light strips in the cabinet base provide good illumination of
              the work surface and create a cosy atmosphere. At the same time,
              the interior of the cabinet is subtly illuminated, making it
              easier to access items such as dishes or food.
